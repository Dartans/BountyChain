BountyBoardChain - Development Plan

Overview

BountyBoardChain is a decentralized bounty system that integrates GitHub and Solana smart contracts to automate bounty management, ensure transparency, and allow contributors to fund, claim, and vote on bounties using a project-specific token system.

Project Goals

Decentralized Bounty Management: Automate issue-based funding and rewards using smart contracts.

Minimal Maintainer Involvement: Maintainers only handle initial setup; GitHub’s tools manage verification.

Public Auditability: Transactions are stored on-chain and displayed on the bounty board for self-auditing.

Sustainable Token Economy: Tokens act as voting shares, and buyback reserves are escrowed for stability.

1. Setup & Deployment

A. Initial Project Setup

1. Merge the BountyBoard repository into the project while maintaining the folder structure.


2. Sync the project with the local client.


3. Copy the configuration file out of the sync directory and update the settings file to point to it.


4. Add the settings file to .gitignore to prevent syncing.



B. Configuration

1. Set up the configuration file with:

Project Wallet: Used for bounty funding.

Signing Wallet: Used for approving bounties.

GitHub Repository URL: Links the project to the bounty system.



2. Fund the Project Wallet to enable bounty issuance.



C. Deployment

1. Run the deployment script to initialize the project on Solana.

2. Smart Contract Functions

A. Bounty Management

New Bounty

Inputs: Amount, GitHub Issue URL

Action:

Creates a bounty tied to a GitHub issue.

Funds are locked in escrow until the bounty is completed.



Auto-Approval for Verified Contributors

Developers with previous successful claims bypass manual approval.


Claim Bounty

Inputs: Approved Wallet Address

Action:

Approved developer claims payout after pull request verification.



B. Payout Verification (Automated)

Before payout, the smart contract verifies:
✔ The GitHub repository exists.
✔ The issue exists in the project.
✔ The bounty timer has not expired.
✔ The pull request was merged with a signoff containing the developer's wallet address.
✔ Funds are available in escrow for payout.

3. Public Funding & Token System

A. Public Funding Pool

50% of all bounty funds are allocated to:

Project Maintainers (50%)

Public Funding Pool (50%)


Public Funding Pool Subdivisions:

50% used to underpin the token economy.

50% allocated as bonus bounties, distributed via voting-based governance.

Funds remain escrowed until withdrawn for bounty awards or token exchanges.



Voting-Based Distribution

The public pool funds bounties based on community voting.

Votes are cast using project tokens, aligning funding with contributor priorities.


B. Tokenomics & Buyback System

Tokens serve as voting shares and are required for governance.

Buyback Reserve Pool:

Tokens can be exchanged for funds only from a separate escrowed reserve.

The reserve is only replenished when a bounty is completed, ensuring long-term stability.

4. Frontend & Bounty Board

A. Web-Based Interface

Hosted on GitHub Pages.

Displays open, in-progress, and completed bounties.

Users can submit, claim, and vote on bounties via a Web3 wallet connection (e.g., Phantom for Solana).


B. Public Auditability

The bounty board pulls completed transactions from the blockchain, allowing self-auditing of payouts.



---

5. Repository Verification & Network Fees

A. Template Repository & Verification Process

The repo for this project will act as a template.

The smart contract includes an optional verification process for ensuring a repo's deployment matches the main branch.

This verification is only required on initialization of a new repo or main repo chain.

A small fee is required to register a new repo, adding it to a trusted board list stored on-chain.


B. Upstream & Downstream Bounty Processing

Any trusted board that processes a bounty will have a % of fees allocated upstream based on network costs.

If a repo fails verification, no upstream fees will be applied.

Every successful upstream transaction generates a vote token for the downstream contract.

Bounty boards will list both upstream and downstream bounties for full transparency.

Final Thoughts

Key Features Implemented

✅ Escrow-Based Bounty Funding to prevent fund mismanagement.
✅ Auto-Approval for Verified Contributors to streamline claims.
✅ Token-Based Voting & Buyback System with a separate reserve pool.
✅ Fully Automated Bounty Verification using GitHub’s built-in tools.
✅ Publicly Auditable Transactions for full transparency.

This plan ensures a sustainable, decentralized bounty system with minimal maintainer involvement while keeping developer incentives aligned.
